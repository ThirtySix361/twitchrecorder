## üß† general informations

this container will scan every minute if the given streamer has started streaming. if so, it will start recording the stream.

if container breaks, shuts down, is killed or has no more internet connection, the captured file will not be corrupted. you will still be able to play it!

on common stream ending, the container will perform a fix on the final `.mp4` file, which will move the header information (which includes also the final length of file) to the begin. this has to do with the way the `.mp4` is written while the stream is running.

all header information are stored at the begin of the file which is uncommon. but only by this way it is possible to have a working file after crash or forceful shutdown of the container and its inner capturing software.

>//<br>//<samp> üí° the `.mp4` files are stored in the `mounts/archive/<channelname>/` directory </samp><br>//

---

## üßê troubleshooting

in case a container was forcefully killed, just re-deploy the container for the given streamer.
it will autofix the files which did not graceful finished.

this can take a while on huge files.
